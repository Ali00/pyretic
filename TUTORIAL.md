TUTORIAL

Running examples is simple.  
Run "screen -S test" and ctrl-a ctrl-c to open a second screen (ctrl-a, ctrl-a toggles between the two).
In one screen run mininet, in the other run the pyretic controller.
Each example file in pyretic/pyretic/examples contains instructions for running and testing.

Start with hub.py, then mac_learner, virtualize, and then explore!
